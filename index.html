    <h1>Crosswords</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is solving crosswords, especially <strong>cryptic</strong> crosswords. <br>
        I love how they’re not just about knowing words, but about figuring out clever clues that <br>
        hide double meanings, wordplay, or even little riddles. It feels like a mix of <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>wordplay</strong>,<br>
        and <strong>creativity</strong> all in one. Cryptics can be frustrating at first, but when the answer clicks, <br>
        it’s such a satisfying moment.
